A Markdown Editor with Vim keybindings

---

How many times have you struggled to find a good online Markdown editor that satisfies your Vim spirit? There are many editors already but the good ones don’t have Vim and the ones do have are not carefully designed. So we decided to build Vim.md.

It’s not just a Markdown editor with Vim keybindings. It is our idea of the best writing experience with complete privacy:

- **Never leave your keyboard:** Vim.md is designed around Vim keybindings, not just the editor but the whole app. You can easily switch between writing modes or browse your files without touching your mouse.
- **Top-notch previewer:** Vim.md’s preview is almost identical to GitHub, from Markdown flavor to syntax highlighting. And it happens in real-time, with smart scroll sync with the editor.
- **Focus on your writing:** Vim.md brings a minimalist design that eliminates any distractions, along with a carefully crafted typography that lets you focus solely on your words.
- **Your data is yours:** Vim.md directly sends requests to GitHub without storing any documents or your personal data. All your documents are stored on your GitHub repository.
